# Chaos Source Code

This is my source code for the multiplayer 3rd person shooter game I'm developing in UE5 and C++! I've added functionality such as a custom multiplayer plugin for creating, hosting, and joining multiplayer sessions, used concepts such as replication for multiplayer functionality, added firing, aiming, aim offsets, smooth animations, crosshairs, cool effects, UI elements for tracking health and eliminations and more! I will update my progress as I go along.
